                <p>
                    This is our privacy policy to indicate what data we
                    (Deadbeat Inc.) collect from you and what we do with it when

                <p>
                    We collect the minimal amount of data to make the software
                    tool work, and no more. We collect your email address and
                    have basic HTTP server logs that monitor our code for any
                    problems. We don’t collect any personal information from
                    you. At times, we may get keyword searches from the Google
                    API that are fed into your account so we can display them to
                    you.
                </p>

                <h3>How do we use the information?</h3>

                <p>
                    We don’t use the information except for sending you an email
                    with updates, and potential marketing or promotional emails.
                    You may opt out at anytime. We don’t share your search data,
                    keywords, or niche topics to any additional party.
